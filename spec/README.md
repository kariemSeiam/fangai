# Fang — production specification

This folder is the **single place** for vision, corrected assumptions, architecture targets, research obligations, and delivery workflow. It is meant to stay ahead of marketing copy and playground prototypes.

**Research bibliography (fill over time)**

- [research/SOURCES-TEMPLATE.md](./research/SOURCES-TEMPLATE.md) — primary URLs for benchmarks, spec, competitors

**Canonical implementation root (Fang monorepo)**

- [`../fang/README.md`](../fang/README.md) — **active** `pnpm` workspace; develop **here**; `playgorund/` remains reference snapshots
- [`../fang/docs/FANG-SPEC.md`](../fang/docs/FANG-SPEC.md) — **implementation draft** (routes, `FangAgentExecutor`, adapters); keep in sync with code in the same PRs that change behavior
- [`../fang/docs/PUBLISHING.md`](../fang/docs/PUBLISHING.md) — **`@fangai/*`** npm checklist, package table, `pnpm publish -r` (pairs with [11](./11-DISTRIBUTION-AND-PUBLISHING.md))
- [`../fang/packages/client`](../fang/packages/client) — **`@fangai/client`** orchestrator-facing API (`FangClient`, `discoverRunningAgents`)

**Related repo artifacts**

- `playgorund/COMPARISON.md` — detailed three-way code comparison (keep in sync when architecture target changes); links back to this spec
- `playgorund/a2a-cli` — historical snapshot; **shipping source** is [`../fang/`](../fang/)
- `playgorund/a2a-cli-01` — reference for **persistent** Pi RPC bridging
- `playgorund/fang` — reference for **ProcessManager**, **Detector**, rich adapter interfaces (Hono server is **not** the target)
- `playgorund/pi-mono`, `playgorund/opencode` — optional **shallow clones** for reading upstream RPC / CLI (see [15-UPSTREAM-PI-AND-OPencode.md](./15-UPSTREAM-PI-AND-OPencode.md))

## Naming

- **Brand:** Fang  
- **Packages:** `@fangai/*` (scoped npm), CLI binary may remain `fang` via `package.json` `bin`

---

## Document control

When you change behavior in code, update **02** or **03** first or in the same PR. Spec drift is a bug.
